The Fake Productivity Assistant is a web app that pretends to help you manage your time but actually ensures you miss deadlines with style. It annoys you with pop-ups, creates fake calendar entries, and celebrates your procrastination like a true buddy!


 The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People are being too productive these days, meeting deadlines and reducing stress. Clearly, that‚Äôs boring!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)

We built a tool that:
Creates fake calendar deadlines (so you‚Äôre always late üéØ).
Sends annoying pop-up reminders that you can‚Äôt escape.
Boosts your annoyance score the more you "work".
Snoozes tasks only to bother you later, because‚Ä¶ why not?
